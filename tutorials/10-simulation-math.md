# Tutorial — Simulation & Mathematics (3 skills)

This category covers discrete-event simulation, exact symbolic mathematics, and MATLAB/Octave numerical computing. Use these when you model systems over time, do exact math, or run numerical computation.

## 1. `simpy`

**What it does.** Process-based **discrete-event simulation** in Python — systems with processes, queues, resources, and time-based events (manufacturing, service operations, network traffic, logistics, or any system where entities interact with shared resources over time).

**Use it when** you need to simulate a system's behavior over time — queues, resource contention, or process flow.

**Example scenario.** A network analyst wants to model routing traffic:
> "Use **simpy** to simulate my **BGP/network traffic** — modeling router queues, resource bottlenecks, and throughput over an observation window."

## 2. `sympy`

**What it does.** **Exact symbolic mathematics** in Python — algebra, calculus, equation solving, symbolic linear algebra, and code generation via lambdify/LaTeX. Prefer it over NumPy/SciPy when floating-point approximations are insufficient.

**Use it when** you need exact symbolic math — symbolic derivatives, integrals, equation solving, or symbolic linear algebra.

**Example scenario.** A network researcher wants an exact symbolic solution:
> "Use **sympy** to derive the **exact symbolic relation** in my routing metric equation, solve the system symbolically, and export the result as LaTeX."

## 3. `matlab`

**What it does.** MATLAB and GNU Octave numerical computing — matrix operations, data analysis, visualization, and scientific computing. Also helps with MATLAB syntax, functions, or converting between MATLAB and Python.

**Use it when** you need MATLAB/Octave scripts for linear algebra, signal/image processing, differential equations, optimization, statistics, or scientific visualizations.

**Example scenario.** A network engineer wants a signal-processing script:
> "Use **matlab** to write an **Octave script** for spectral analysis of my BGP signal — FFT, filtering, and visualization — and convert the approach to Python."
